                "content": "So earlier this week I built my first real side project using plain javascript to make ajax calls to the Battle.net provided by Blizzard. Using this data I created a character viewer for the MMORPG World of Warcraft. I was really happy when I finally saw those images and character stats load on the page when I submitted the form data. <p> I learnt a lot during the process, in fact the main take away from that project was that I really enjoy programming for the web in javascript. It's taken me a long time to get to grips with it and more and more concepts are starting to make sense.</p> <p> Following on from that, I have now built a web page that loads a JSON file and iterates through it, creating blog posts. Which is what you're reading this on. Wicked stuff, thanks for reading!</p>"

How do people interact with objects? How do people interact with each other? Are there interactions that occur only within Mshed that otherwise may not occur in everyday life? <p> These were some of the questions we attempted to answer through observation and interviews. Also, the coffee they served was great!</p>"
